# Vibecode Gallery

[https://github.com/dcdigit/vibecode-gallery](https://github.com/dcdigit/vibecode-gallery)

**Host code generated by Generative AI tools like Claude.** 

This gallery demonstrates a small range of React code artifacts Claude (and tools like it) can create - from simple buttons to complex 3D animations and interactive elements.

All of these were "vibecoded" - no human touched the code. If you want to vibecode, all you have to do is tell Claude (or any other AI chatbot) to create an artifact (Claude's terminology). Claude will create a React component. You can copy the resulting code, save it in this project, and this framework helps you host that code in a deployed site.

This Vibecode Gallery framework itself was set up using AI-assist coding techniques.

## What problem does this solve?

When working with Claude or similar AI assistants, you often get code snippets as "artifacts" - functional pieces of code that solve a specific problem. Code that Claude generates runs in their "artifact" in the browser. This is great! It's fun to prototype and ask the AI to make changes and see it all work in front of you.

However, there are several challenges:

- **Isolated Environment**: Claude's artifacts are generated in a mini-hosted environment with specific code dependencies and site configurations, making them difficult to run elsewhere without modification.
- **Integration Difficulties**: To run these artifacts in your own projects means you practically have to be a professional developer. Getting these code fragments to run outside of the Claude artifact in the browser requires significant setup and configuration to match Claude's environment.
- **Multiple Artifact Management**: Viewing and comparing multiple artifacts from different conversations can be cumbersome.
- **Dependency Management**: Setting up the right libraries and frameworks for each artifact takes time and effort.

This gallery solves these problems by providing:
- A ready-to-use hosting environment that mimics Claude's code execution environment
- A framework for displaying multiple artifacts in one convenient location
- Proper dependency management and configuration automatically handled
- Easy deployment options to share your artifacts with others

Simply drop in the React components (see below for details) generated by Claude, and they'll render properly without additional configuration.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Claude understands what you mean when you say "artifact" but other AI code generation tools will require more specific instructions like this  "create a functional React component with a default export and be sure to list any npm installs I will need"

Another IMPORTANT NOTE: Claude doesn't know about this environment so it might create artifacts that require libraries that are not installed. This is no problem! You can install npm packages here and support any idea you have.

## Components - Rendered with Astro.js

Here is a sample collection of components and visual effects generated by Claude. The site itself is built with Astro.js. React is only used in the artifacts section because that is what Claude (and other Gen AI code tools) usually create. 

Each artifact demonstrates Claude's capability to produce production-ready code for a range of experiences. This starter collection demonstrates a few common UI patterns, plus visual and audio effects. Many of them are one-shot (single command to generate the fully-working code), and many have been tuned and worked on using Claude (or other tools).

In summary, Astro.js serves as the site generator that hosts and renders the React components created by Claude, providing an efficient and performant way to showcase these components. The combination of Astro's static site generation capabilities with Claude's React component development enables a seamless ai-code-generation-dev-to-production workflow.

## Adding Your Own Artifacts

### Using the artifacts directory

1. Create a new `.jsx` or `.tsx` file in the `src/components/artifacts/` directory
2. Make sure to use the code style typical of React components. Export your component as the default export in the React code. It should look like this at the bottom: `export default HelloWorld;`
3. Astro is watching the files so the setup script will automatically register your new component

Example (this works and shows a direct function export, Claude will usually put the "export default" line at the bottom of the file as shown in the examples that come with this repo):
```javascript
// src/components/artifacts/my-new-component.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function MyNewComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">My New Component</h2>
      <p>This is a new artifact generated by Claude!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Here's a sample prompt and the code that was generated
Here is a super-boring sample prompt that will give you code in Claude AI:
`Create an artifact that counts and displays the number of times a user clicks each of 3 circular buttons.`

It created this (you can literally copy/paste this into a new .jsx file in the src/components/artifacts directory):

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ButtonCounter = () => {
  // State to track click counts for each button
  const [counts, setCounts] = useState({
    red: 0,
    blue: 0,
    green: 0
  });

  // Function to handle button clicks
  const handleClick = (button) => {
    setCounts(prevCounts => ({
      ...prevCounts,
      [button]: prevCounts[button] + 1
    }));
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center p-8 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg shadow-md w-full max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Button Click Counter</h2>
      
      <div className="flex justify-around w-full mb-8">
        {/* Red Button */}
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <button
            onClick={() => handleClick('red')}
            className="w-24 h-24 rounded-full bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 active:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2 flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg transition-all duration-200 transform hover:scale-105 active:scale-95"
          >
            Click
          </button>
          <div className="text-center">
            <p className="text-gray-600">Red Button</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">{counts.red}</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Blue Button */}
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <button
            onClick={() => handleClick('blue')}
            className="w-24 h-24 rounded-full bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 active:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2 flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg transition-all duration-200 transform hover:scale-105 active:scale-95"

          </button>
          <div className="text-center">
            <p className="text-gray-600">Blue Button</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-600">{counts.blue}</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Green Button */}
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <button
            onClick={() => handleClick('green')}
            className="w-24 h-24 rounded-full bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 active:bg-green-700 text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2 flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg transition-all duration-200 transform hover:scale-105 active:scale-95"
          >
            Click
          </button>
          <div className="text-center">
            <p className="text-gray-600">Green Button</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-green-600">{counts.green}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow w-full">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Total Clicks</h3>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          <div className="text-center p-2 bg-red-100 rounded">
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Red</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-red-600">{counts.red}</p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-center p-2 bg-blue-100 rounded">
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Blue</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-600">{counts.blue}</p>
          </div>
          <div className="text-center p-2 bg-green-100 rounded">
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Green</p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-green-600">{counts.green}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="mt-3 text-center text-lg font-bold">
          Total: {counts.red + counts.blue + counts.green}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ButtonCounter;
```

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.js` to customize your gallery:

```javascript
export const siteConfig = {
  title: "Your Gallery Title",
  description: "A custom description for your artifact gallery",
  artifacts: {
    showDescription: true,
    showCreationDate: true,
    sortBy: "lastModified", // Options: "name", "lastModified"
    sortDirection: "desc"  // Options: "asc", "desc"
  }
};
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed to your preferred hosting service like Netlify.

## Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

- If artifacts aren't showing up, check that your component is properly exported as default
- For 3D components, ensure the three module is properly called into the component
- Check the browser console and the server console for any JavaScript errors if your artifact isn't rendering properly
- Make sure your component file name doesn't contain special characters
